Kerberos authentication is a network authentication protocol designed to provide strong authentication for client/server applications by using secret-key cryptography. At its core, Kerberos is based on the Needham-Schroeder symmetric key protocol and was developed as part of MIT's Project Athena. The primary objective of Kerberos is to authenticate users to services and services to users in a secure and transparent manner, without the need for transmitting passwords over the network.

#### How Kerberos Works:

1. **Initial Authentication**: The user logs in, and the Kerberos client system sends a pre-authentication request to the Key Distribution Center (KDC), specifically to the Authentication Server (AS) component. The user’s password is used to encrypt this request.
2. **TGT Issuance**: Upon successful authentication, the AS responds with a Ticket-Granting Ticket (TGT), encrypted using a key derived from the user's password. The user’s system decrypts this TGT using the user's password and stores it for future use.
3. **Service Request**: When the user needs to access a service (e.g., a file server), the client requests a service ticket from the KDC's Ticket-Granting Service (TGS) using the TGT.
