# 7️⃣ ESC7

This avenue of exploitation is particularly interesting to me, given the indirect nature of Domain compromise or Domain privilege escalation. A Domain being vulnerable to ESC7 includes a low privileged users’ ability to manage the Certificate Authority (CA), specifically with the “ManageCA” and “ManageCertificates” permissions.&#x20;

These permissions can be utilized to modify the CA configuration, and can lead to serious security breaches. For instance, with these permissions, one can manipulate the “EDITF\_ATTRIBUTESUBJECTALTNAME2” flag that was mentioned in ESC6.&#x20;

This flag is instrumental in controlling certificate issuance and management.&#x20;

By allowing any principal with the “ManageCA” permission to configure the CA as vulnerable to ESC6, this can create a systemic risk within the infrastructure.

This furthermore makes the “Manager Approval” security setting obsolete, since it allows direct approval of pending certificate requests, bypassing typical security protocols.&#x20;

In essence, anyone with the “ManageCA” permission can potentially introduce widespread vulnerabilities by configuring inappropriate certificate attributes or approving malicious requests without higher-level oversight.&#x20;

This kind of unchecked access can lead to substantial security implications, making it a critical vector for attackers aiming to exploit Domain vulnerabilities.

Given this, it becomes essential to implement stringent access controls and review processes for permissions like “ManageCA” and “ManageCertificates” to avert the risks associated with such exploitation potentials.&#x20;

Regular audits, along with continuous monitoring of CA configurations, should be instituted to promptly identify and mitigate any unauthorized changes or suspicious activities. These measures will help in minimizing the risks associated with Domain privilege escalation and CA mismanagement, thereby enhancing the overall security posture of the organization.
