### S4U2Self (Service for User to Self)

S4U2Self, or "Service for User to Self," is a Kerberos extension that allows a service to obtain a Kerberos ticket on behalf of a user.&#x20;

This process does not require the user's credentials and is particularly useful in scenarios where services need to act on behalf of users without direct interaction.&#x20;

S4U2Self is part of the broader set of extensions known as S4U (Services for User) and is implemented to improve the delegation capabilities within Kerberos environments, enhancing security and reducing the need for credential handling.
