# UnPAC the Hash

## UnPAC the Hash

UnPAC the Hash is a process utilized in cyber security to extract and analyze the encrypted hash portion of a Kerberos ticket, specifically from the Privileged Attribute Certificate (PAC).&#x20;

The goal is to decode the hash values which often contain critical information such as user privileges, allowing for deeper security assessment and potential vulnerability identification within an authenticated session.&#x20;

This technique is particularly useful for auditing and ensuring the integrity of security policies in a network environment.
