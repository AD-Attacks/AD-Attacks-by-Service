# ASREQroast

### ASREQroast

ASREQroast is a technique used in cybersecurity to extract AS-REP (Authentication Service Response) messages from a Kerberos server in environments where accounts do not require pre-authentication.

The captured AS-REP messages can then be subjected to offline brute force or dictionary attacks to crack the password of the targeted user account.
