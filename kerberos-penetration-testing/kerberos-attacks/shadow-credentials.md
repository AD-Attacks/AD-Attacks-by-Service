# Shadow Credentials

### Shadow Credentials

Shadow credentials refer to alternative or hidden authentication data that allows access to systems or resources without using the primary credentials.&#x20;

These can include undocumented access methods, such as secret API keys, developer backdoors, or unaccounted for user accounts, that bypass standard authentication mechanisms.&#x20;

Shadow credentials pose a security risk as they might be unknown to system administrators, making them a hidden vector for unauthorized access or attacks.
