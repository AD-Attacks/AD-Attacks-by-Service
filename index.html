    <h1>Welcome to Our Hacking Scene</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the Active Directory Attacks Documentation for Red Teams!</p>
    
     <p> This documentation serves as a comprehensive resource for understanding various attack techniques and vulnerabilities associated with Active Directory environments. Whether you are a security professional, system administrator, or simply interested in learning about cybersecurity, this documentation will provide valuable insights into the risks and countermeasures related to Active Directory attacks.</p>
     <p>In this documentation, you will find detailed explanations of different attack techniques employed by malicious actors to compromise Active Directory infrastructures. We cover well-known techniques such as Pass-the-Hash, Golden Ticket, Kerberoasting, and more. Each attack technique is accompanied by a description, potential impact, detection methods, and recommended mitigation strategies.</p>
     <p>Our aim is to help you understand the inner workings of these attacks, enabling you to identify vulnerabilities within your own Active Directory environment and implement effective security measures to protect against them. Additionally, we provide real-world examples and practical guidance to enhance your understanding of the attack vectors and their implications.</p>
     <p>Remember, a well-informed defender is better equipped to safeguard their Active Directory environment against malicious actors. Let's dive in and strengthen our defenses against Active Directory attacks!</p>
     <p>Happy learning and stay secure!</p>
